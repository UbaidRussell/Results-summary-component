## Overview
  Results summary component is a website that shows the results of a survey. It is a simple website that is easy to navigate and understand. It is a website that is responsive and can be viewed on any device.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size []
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page []

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Before this project I have never used linear-gradient and I find it has been cool to give a space or area two different colors

```css
    background-image: linear-gradient(hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1),hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0));
```

### Continued development
 
We intend to continue working on beautiful elegant websites that come alive

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/func_linear-gradient.php) - This website by W3schools has helped me make the linear gradient you see in the circle on the left sided card and has proved to be extremely helpful.
