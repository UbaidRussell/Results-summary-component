## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Before this project I have never used linear-gradient and I find it has been cool to give a space or area two different colors

```css
    background-image: linear-gradient(hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1),hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0));
```

### Continued development
 
We intend to continue working on beautiful elegant websites that come alive

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/func_linear-gradient.php) - This website by W3schools has helped me make the linear gradient you see in the circle on the left sided card and has proved to be extremely helpful.
